      <h1><b>JAMAL <span className='text-grad'>MAHIJIBAI</span><br/>PRESIDENT & CEO</b></h1><br />
      <p>For nearly two decades, MSG Staffing has had a profound impact on my life. As a registered nurse, I founded this company to gain autonomy, flexibility, and freedom. However, over the years, I've realized that these factors alone are not enough. I wanted to build a business that not only fulfilled our financial needs but also allowed us to enhance patient care and healthcare outcomes on a global scale.</p>
      <p>Today, EmpowerCare is more than just a trademark; it's a brand that takes MSG Staffing's vision to new heights. We envision a world where every healthcare institution experiences seamless operations, and every healthcare professional finds fulfilling opportunities.</p>
